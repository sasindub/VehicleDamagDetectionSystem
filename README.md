# VehicleDamagDetectionSystem

Automobile industry is a most important industry, and the insurance companies are rapidly expanding. But they give the insurance claim to vehicles in a traditional way.

After checking the accident manually, they give the claim.
Also, an inspector is required to physically analyze the vehicles to assess the damage and obtain a cost estimate.
There is also the possibility of inaccurate settlements due to human errors.
There can be a chance to cheat to the clients.

Automating such a process with the help of machine learning and remote usage would make the process a lot more convenient for both sides of the damage, increasing productivity of the insurance carrier and satisfaction of the customer.

It will be a most demanding system within the insurance companies.
